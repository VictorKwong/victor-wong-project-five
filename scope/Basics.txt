#Pseudo Code

MVP:
* User can input their pokemon (name or id, Ex. Pikachu)
* Once user submit the their id/pokemon name, componentDidUpdate will use setState to update the data
* Use the updated variables to show the selected pokemon information
* Can choose other pokemon if user didn't like their previous Pokemon (unlimited times)


Strech goals:
* Create a NPC button also select their pokemon
* Battle button appears once both pokemon button are selected
* Once battle button submit, pokemon will compare their status (attack,defence,speed etc)
* Show the battle result
